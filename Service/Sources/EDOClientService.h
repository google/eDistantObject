/**

 *  The linker can't resolve class symbols when it compiles the class method statically. This macro
 *  helps to generate the stub implementation where it forwards the class method to the remote
 *  class object.
 *
 *  @note   This is not encouraged because this can resolve many remote invocations and has
 *          different memory implications, but it can provide a workaround to translate your code to
 *          a remote invocation without any modifications. If only the class method is needed, try
 *          to not enable the alloc. Because the local NSZone is passing to +[allocWithZone:], and
 *          NSZone is deprecating (also it's a struct and not supported), +[alloc] is used.
 *
 *  @param  clz The class literal.
 *  @param  p   The port that the service listens on.
