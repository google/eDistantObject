 *  any -retain/-release if safe in the context of source file. As eDO builds the remote invocation
 *  using @c NSInvocation, this context will be lost and ARC treats the memory as what
 *  @c NSInvocation states, that is, the annotation gets lost and all the returns are already
 *  balanced. However the return will still be retained if the method family is one of alloc, new,
 *  mutableCopy, copy. ARC will balance this by inserting an extra release on the caller, and the
 *  object returned will have an extra retain count, thus we need to:
 *   1) insert an extra retain on the caller;
 *   2) insert an extra release on the receiver,
 *  then the retain count will be balanced.
