/** NSObject extension to help with weak referenced objects. */
@interface NSObject (EDOWeakObject)

/**
 * Wraps an NSObject into a EDOWeakObject.
 *
 * Boxes an object into a EDOWeakObject, which is an NSProxy that directs any call to the original
 * object. User would use this method when testing with weakly referenced objects.
 *
 * Usage for assigning a weak reference to object:
 * Original usage: weakReference = object;
 * Updated usage:  weakReference = [object remoteWeak];
 *
 * When a user references an underlying object weakly across processes remotely, since there were
 * no ownership to the object across processes, the underlying object will be deallocated
 * immediately. Through the usage of remoteWeak, the underlying object is wrapped to an
 * EDOWeakObject which directs any call to the underlying object. At the same time, EDOWeakObject
 * is added and owned by a weakly referenced objects library at the host side. It is then retained
 * and won't get deallocated immediately. After the underlying object is out of scope, the
 * deallocation tracker helps to remove the strong reference to EDOWeakObject, so the memory gets
 * released.
 *
 * Passing weak objects that point to the same underlying object to multiple EDO client services is
 * *not* supported and doing so will lead to objects not being cleaned up properly on the client.
